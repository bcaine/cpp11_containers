### cpp11_containers

The purpose of this repo is for me to play with creating different data structures in C++

Starting super basic, with the idea to continue to expand complexity. These are written for educational purposes, and not recommended for general use.

### Building

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

You can then run the tests
